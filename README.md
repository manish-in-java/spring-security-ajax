# 1. Introduction
A number of rich JavaScript frameworks have become available since 2010 that allow developers
to provide near-desktop quality user experience over the web.  Traditional HTTP request-response
flows for web applications are steadily being replaced with AJAX flows.  This trend has gained
even more traction with the advent of JavaScript MVC libraries such as Backbone.js and
Ember.js.  One of the challenges that application development teams when adopting such libraries
for existing applications is to enforce proper security controls on the AJAX calls originating
from such libraries.

This sample application demonstrates how Spring Security can be used to secure and protect
application resources in an AJAX environment.
